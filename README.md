# ABSA
Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a task involving entity recognition followed by sentiment analysis linked to the determined entity. This task can serve multiple purposes such as review analysis and brand reputation monitoring. These aspects are particularly useful for monitoring churn rates, allowing any criticized aspect to be appropriately addressed and rectified to prevent future issues and reduce abandonment rates. 
Additionally, it can be used for brand reputation analysis by examining news articles to understand and compare brands or products and aspects of a particular brand.

# Implementation
Aspect-based sentiment analysis is implemented in a fully AI generative manner, providing a greater understanding of the entire semantic meaning of the sentence. In this repository, OpenAI with GPT-3.5 Turbo is utilized, and the interface is created using Streamlit. Extraction can be performed either by entering text into the form or by inputting an entire review file.

Furthermore, the ability to display the reason for sentiment and the tone concerning a specific aspect or entity has been added.
